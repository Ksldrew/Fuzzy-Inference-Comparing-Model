## Grid-Partition Feasibility in Traditional TSK-FIS (4-Feature vs 11-Feature)

### Purpose

This implementation examines the **scalability and memory feasibility** of a **traditional (monolithic) Takagi–Sugeno–Kang Fuzzy Inference System (TSK-FIS)** using the **classical grid-partition rule base**, under both **low-dimensional (4-feature)** and **high-dimensional (11-feature)** settings.

The objective is to demonstrate how rule growth and memory demand evolve with dimensionality, and why architectural modification is required for high-dimensional inputs.

---

## Traditional TSK-FIS Architecture

In its classical formulation, a traditional TSK-FIS constructs fuzzy rules using **grid-partitioning**, where all combinations of membership functions across input variables are enumerated.

For an input space with ( d ) features and ( M_j ) membership functions per feature, the total number of rules is:

[
R = \prod_{j=1}^{d} M_j
]

This formulation provides **complete rule coverage** and is widely adopted in foundational TSK-FIS literature.

## Case 1: 4-Feature Grid-Partition (Feasible Baseline)

### Feature Configuration

The 4-feature traditional TSK-FIS uses:

* Age
* BMI
* Cholesterol
* Systolic Blood Pressure (ap_hi)

Each feature is represented using a small number of membership functions (typically 3–5 per feature).

### Rule Count

[
R_{4D} = M_1 \times M_2 \times M_3 \times M_4 \approx 10^1 \text{ to } 10^2 \text{ rules}
]

### Feasibility

* Grid-partition rule base is **fully instantiated**
* Firing-strength matrices are small
* Training and inference run **successfully on CPU**
* Memory usage remains well within limits

### Role in This Study

The 4-feature grid-based TSK-FIS serves as:

* A **valid traditional baseline**
* A continuation of the FYP1 implementation
* A reference point for evaluating scalability limitations

---

## Case 2: 11-Feature Grid-Partition (Infeasible)

### Feature Configuration

The 11-feature configuration includes:

* Age, Height, Weight
* ap_hi, ap_lo
* Cholesterol, Glucose
* Gender, Smoking, Alcohol, Physical Activity

Membership function counts vary by feature (2–5 per feature).

### Rule Count

[
R_{11D} = 288{,}000 \text{ fuzzy rules}
]

### Memory Estimation

For the test dataset ((N = 10{,}500)):

* Firing-strength matrix alone requires **~22.53 GB** (float64)
* This excludes:

  * Rule parameters
  * Normalization buffers
  * Aggregation outputs
  * Python runtime overhead

### Execution Decision

Under a **32 GB RAM CPU environment**, explicitly constructing the full grid-partition rule base is **computationally infeasible**.

To prevent system instability and meaningless crashes:

* A **feasibility check** is performed
* Execution is **deliberately terminated** when the rule count exceeds a safety threshold
* The grid is **analysed analytically rather than instantiated**

---

## Research Implication

The contrast between the two cases demonstrates that:

* Traditional TSK-FIS with grid-partition is **practical and correct** for low-dimensional inputs (4 features)
* The same architecture becomes **non-scalable** in high-dimensional settings due to **exponential rule growth**
* The observed limitation is **architectural**, not an implementation error

This motivates the adoption of scalable alternatives, such as the **Modular TSK-FIS**, which preserves fuzzy interpretability while avoiding the dimension trap.

---

## Key Takeaways

* Grid-partition represents the **theoretically complete and classical** TSK-FIS formulation
* Feasible for low-dimensional problems (4 features)
* Computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional problems (11 features)
* Memory infeasibility is a **structural scalability issue**

---

## Reproducibility Note

All rule count and memory estimations are deterministic, based on:

* Fixed membership function counts
* Dataset size
* Standard float64 representations

No heuristic approximation is used.
